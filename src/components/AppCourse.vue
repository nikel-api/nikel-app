                In this first introduction to Calculus, students will be
                introduced to the tools of differential calculus, the branch of
                calculus that is motivated by the problem of measuring how
                quantities change. Students will use these tools to solve other
                problems, including simplifying functions with straight lines,
                describing how different types of change are related, and
                computing maximum and minimum quantities. This course will focus
                on developing a deep understanding of why the tools of calculus
                make sense and how to apply them to the social, biological, and
                physical sciences. It will also emphasize translating between
                algebraic, graphical, numerical and verbal descriptions of each
                concept studied.
